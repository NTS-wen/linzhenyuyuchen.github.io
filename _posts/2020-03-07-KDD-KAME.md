1. visit-level evaluation 

visit-level precision@k is defined
as the correct medical codes in top k divided by min(k, |yt|), where |yt| is the number of category labels in the (t +1)-th visit.

2. code-level evaluation

given a visit Vt which contains
multiple category labels, if the target label is in the top k guesses,
then we get 1 and 0 otherwise. Thus, code-level accuracy@k is defined by the number of correct label predictions divided by the total number of label predictions.
