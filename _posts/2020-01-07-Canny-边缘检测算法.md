# Canny

> Canny is a popular edge detection algorithm, and as the name suggests, it detects the edges of objects present in an image. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. The algorithm involves several steps.

1. Noise reduction: Since edge detection is susceptible to noise in an image, we remove the noise in the image using a 5x5 Gaussian filter.高斯滤波抑制噪声平滑图像


2. Finding Intensity Gradient of the Image: The smoothened image is then filtered with a Sobel kernel in both horizontal and vertical directions to get the first derivative in the horizontal (Gx) and vertical (Gy) directions. From these two images, one can find the edge gradient and direction for each pixel.用一阶偏导的有限差分来计算梯度的幅值和方向


3. Rounding: The gradient is always perpendicular to edges. So, it is rounded to one of the four angles representing vertical, horizontal and two diagonal directions.

4. Non-maximum suppression: After getting the gradient magnitude and direction, a full scan of the image is done to remove any unwanted pixels which may not constitute the edge. For this, we check every pixel for being a local maximum in its neighborhood in the direction of the gradient.仅仅得到全局的梯度并不足以确定边缘，因此为确定边缘，必须保留局部梯度最大的点，而抑制非极大值

5. Hysteresis Thresholding: This stage decides which parts are edges and which are not. For this, we need two threshold values, minVal and maxVal. Any edges with intensity gradient greater than maxVal are considered edges and those lesser than minVal are considered non-edges, and discarded. Those who lie between these two thresholds are classified edges or non-edges based on their neighborhood. If they are near “sure-edge” pixels, they are considered edges, and otherwise, they are discarded.用双阈值算法检测和连接边缘

The result of these five steps is a two-dimensional binary map (0 or 255) indicating the location of edges on the image. Canny edge is demonstrated below with a few leaf images:
